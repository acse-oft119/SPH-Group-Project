This tool has been implemented in C++ with Python as a means to analyze data and
test the output of the code. Bellow is the documentation of the functions used
in the tool and an analysis of the testing pipline.

* Code structure, Class variables and functions
The tool is composed of two classes /SPH_particle/ and /SPH_main/.
/SPH_particle/ is an object that represents each individual particle in our
simulation and holds parameters and values that are specific to every particle
(eg. position, velocity, etc). /SPH_main/ represents the domain the simulation
is using and holds all the functions, globals and data strucutres needed to run
the simulation.

- update_gradients(/double r[]/, /SPH_particle* part/, /SPH_particle* other_part/) (void) ::
  Updating the values of rate of change of speed (acceleration) and density.
  + /part/ is a pointer to the particle that we calculate the change
    for.
  + /other_part/ is a pointer to the neighbouring particle used in the calculation.
    The calculations are done according to the following functions:
  \begin{equation}
     \alpha_i = - \sum_{j=1}^{N} m_j \Big(\frac{P_i}{\rho_i^2} + \frac{P_j}{\rho_j^2} \Big) \frac{dW}{dr}(r_{ij},h)e_{ij} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} m_j \Big( \frac{1}{\rho_i^2} + \frac{1}{\rho_j^2} \Big) \frac{dW}{dr}(r_{ij}, h) \frac{v_{ij}} {r_{ij}}

  \end{equation}
- density_field_smoothing(/SPH_particle* part/) (void) :: Smoothing out the
  Density/Pressure field. This is done because the integration of the continuity
  equation will result in variations in density and pressure based on the
  macroscopic velocity gradients, but also on local variations in particle
  spacing and velocity; resulting in a "rough" density and pressure
  distributions. To get around this problem, we implemented a density smoother.
  + /part/ is a pointer to the particle whose density is to be smoothed.

  \begin{equation}
  \rho_i = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^{n} W(r_{ij},h)}{ \sum_{j = 1}^{n} \frac{W(r_{ij})}{\rho_j}}}
   \end{equation}

- set_values(/double delta_x/) (void) :: Setting simulation parameters.
  + /delta_x/ the distance between particles in the initial configuration.
- initialize_grid(/void/) (void) :: This function initializes the search grid
  used to find neighbours. This is done by dividing the points into cell grids
  of size double the initial distance between particles and allocating them to
  the corresponding cell.
- place_points(/double min0/, /double min1/, /double max0/, /double max1/, /bool type/) (void) ::
  This function is responsible for initializing the points to the domain, by
  setting all the variables (as defined in the /SPH_particle/ variables).
  + /min0/ minimum position value for the x-direction.
  + /min1/ minimum position value for the y-direction.
  + /max0/ maximum position value for the x-direction.
  + /max1/ maximum position value for the y-direction.
  + /type/ boolean that defines weather or not the particle is on the boundary.
- allocate_to_grid(/void/) (void) :: Allocates all the points to the search grid
  (assumes that index has been appropriately updated). This function is called
  in every iteration step, as the movement of the particles might change their
  corresponding search grid cell.
- neighbour_iterate(/SPH_particle* part/) (void) :: The main function that
  searches the search grid to find the corresponding neighbours for the given
  particle. Iterates through a particle's neighbours within 2h with a stencil
  scheme, and update the gradients for pairs of particles. This function is
  called twice in one iteration (one per half-step).
  + /part/ the particle for which the neighbours are searched.
- update_particle(/SPH_particle* part/) (void) :: Function that updates the
  position, velocity, density and pressure, according to the results of the
  /update_gradients/ functions.
  + /part/ the particle for which the variables are updated.
- reset_grid_count() (void) :: This function resets the grid count of the domain
  after every iteration.
- update_rho(/SPH_particle* part/) (void) :: This function updates the density
  of the particle after each half and whole timestep.
  + /part/ the particle for which the density is updated.
- store_initial(/SPH_particle* part/) (void) :: This function stores the initial
  velocity, density and position for the second order time-stepping scheme.
  + /part/ input particle to store
 
- time_dynamic() (void) :: Finds the timestep for next iteration by finding the
  minimum of three other timesteps calculated using the maximum velocity,
  density and acceleration. This function is called in every iteration.
- full_update(/SPH_particle* part/) (void) :: The final update of particle for
  each iteration using the second order method.
  + /part/ particle to receive full update.
- get_new_max(/SPH_particle* part/) (void) :: Gets the new global maximum
  velocity acceleration and density.
  + /part/ particle to get new max from.
- repulsion(/SPH_particle* part/, /double dist/) (double) :: Calculate the
  repulsive force to a particle by the boundary.
  + /part/ particle to apply the repulsive force to.
  + /dist/ distance between the particle and the nearby boundary.
- update_particle_FE(/SPH_particle* part/) :: update function for the first order method.

* Parallelization with OpenMP
OpenMP was used to parallelize the computation of the simulation. The /#pragma omp
for loops/ exist on the /SPH_Snippet/, parallelizing the looping over all
particles. Since our /update_particle/ and /neighbout_iterate/ functions operate
on two particles in the same time, the /#pragma omp atomic/ directive was added
at the parts of the code where we update the particle values, to ensure that no
more than one process accesses and edits them at one time.

* Running the Simulation, Post-processing and Output scripts
A sample C++ file (/SPH_Snippet.cpp/) has been provided in the package that runs
the simulation for the parameters required for the class excericse. That file is
responsible for the entirety of the simulation and serves as a template for any
future simulations anyone would want to run using this tool. Moreover, a
number of post processing scripts have been implemented in C++ and Python for
the purpose of outputing the simulation states in a suitable format for both
visualization and data manipulation.

** file_writer.cpp
A simple C++ file that outputs simulation steps as /.vtp/ files; to be used with
ParaView or other software that is build upon the /VTK/ library.
** post.py
A simple Python script that takes the /.vtp/ files created by /file_writer.cpp/,
creates a Pandas DataFrame for every iteration step and outputs them in a HDF5
file (for easy data transport and data manipulation). A similar version of the
script is used in the testing pipeline in the step where the testing moves from
C++ to Python.

* Testing
Testing on this tool is done by both C++ and Python. For C++ the BOOST library
is used and for Python a custom test file has been written.

** C++ Testing
The C++ side of the testing handles all the mathematical functions defined in
the /SPH_main/ class. Namely /cubic_spline/, /cubic_spline_first_derivative/ and
/update_gradients/. A set of BOOST test cases has been set that depends on the
possible outputs of the spline functions. Note, that the same principle is
applied for /update_gradients/ as the cubic spline functions play an important
role in the calculation of acceleration and rate of change of pressure.
Moreover, the tests are conducted independently of the model parameters (as they
are defined in the /set_vales/ functions), by setting the desired parameters
before the function call.
** Python Testing
The Python part of the testing deals with validating the behaviour of the
simulator; checking that the particles stay within the boundaries and that the
particles are present at their proper positions after /N/ iterations steps. This
part of the testing can be used for validating that the input parameters by the
user fall within the power of the simulator (ie that the simulator does not
become unstable).
** Testing pipeline
The teting pipeline goes as follows:
1. The objects and C++ classes get compiled.
2. The Python script /run_tests.py/ is being run, which is responsible for
   running both the C++ and Python tests.
3. The C++ test file /test_SPH_2D.cpp/ is run, followed by
   /test_file_writer.cpp/ which outputs a set of /.vtp/ files, containing the
   iteration steps of the test simulator.
4. /test_post.py/ is called (a specialised version of /post.py/) which processes
   the /.vtp/ files and creates the /output_test.h5/ file, containing all the
   Pandas DataFrames to be used by the Python part of the tests.
5. /python_tests.py/ is run with /output_test.h5/ as input; completing a number
   of tests on the behaviour of the simulator.

*Note: The following commands are to be entered from the base repository of the package.*
The complete testing pipeline can be run by using:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make runtests
#+END_SRC

To run only the C++ tests you can use:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./tests/bin/test_SPH_2D
#+END_SRC
The /--log_level=unit_scope/ flag can be used to give a detailed report of the
testing suite and /--list_content/ provides the user for a description of each
testing case for easier debugging.

To produce the /.vtp/ files you can use:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./tests/bin/test_file_writer
#+END_SRC

To produce the /.h5/ test files you can use:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python ./tests/test_post.py
#+END_SRC
(It goes without saying that the /.vtp/ files need to already exist for the
/.h5/ files to be produced.)
* Arbitrary Boundaries (beta)
This is a separate scheme for arbitrary convex polygon shaped domains. To use it, substitute the relevant files in the source file with the ones under arbitrary/. It applies Forward Euler time-stepping and direct push back boundary mechanism. Its member functions are mostly the same with the original scheme, with the following differences:new attributes in the SPH_main class:
+ vector<vector<double>> boundaries, vertices, areas:
stores information of boundaries and vertices of the domain polygon and rectangular areas containing moving particles.
+ set<vector<int>> near_boundary:
stores the indices of grids that are near the boundary.
+ int vcount:
the number of vertices.is_inside:
This function decides if a boundary particle lies inside the domain polygon. It iterates through each boundaries, performs cross product on the vectors from boundary endpoints to the particle to determine which side it lies on.place_points_new:
For boundary particles (type = 1), the first 4 arguments describe the coordinates of the two end points of a line. Boundary particles will be placed every dx on the line, and 3 more lines of particles will be placed outside, parallel to this line each at a distance of dx.
For moving particles (type = 0), the first 4 arguments still define the
bottom-left and top-right points of a rectangle. The particles in the rectangle
will be placed if its inside the polygon (determined using is_inside )
