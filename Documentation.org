#+TITLE: Documentation

This tool has been implemented in C++ with Python as a means to analyze data and
test the output of the code. Bellow is the documentation of the functions used
in the tool and an analysis of the testing pipline.

* Code structure, Class variables and functions
The tool is composed of two classes /SPH_particle/ and /SPH_main/.
/SPH_particle/ is an object that represents each individual particle in our
simulation and holds parameters and values that are specific to every particle
(eg. position, velocity, etc). /SPH_main/ represents the domain the simulation
is using and holds all the functions, globals and data strucutres needed to run
the simulation.

** /SPH_particle/
Class variables:
- x[] (double) :: position
- v[] (double) :: velocity
- rho (double) :: density
- P (double) :: pressure
